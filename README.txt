USER GUIDE

When the maze is run, the user will be prompted to select a search algorithm by
pressing:

	"b" to display a maze that will run a Breadth First Search. 
    "d" to display a maze that will run a Depth First Search. 

The user will not be able to switch between search algorithms while the search
is running. However, the user can change the display of the maze during the
searching process by pressing:

        "1" to display the only the maze's path
	"2" to display the only maze's walls
	"3" to display both the maze's path and walls
	"4" to display none
        “5” to display the ultimate path only
	

The user can press "n" only after finishing the searching. After a new random maze 
is created, the search will only begin when the user  selects an algorithm 
again by pressing "b" or "d".
